# BooksHub
Web app for book lovers, made by my curious self and with more features! This project is basically me covering all the skills I learned during my summer internship as a developer and going the extra mile to build a fully developed web app (even though I suck at front end web development👀). 

## What I've learned working on this project
- 📝 Hiding secret files like an api key in .env files and in config vars for deployment in Heroku
- 📝 Setting up SSH for GitHub for my MacBook
    - 📌 Use GitHub's steps for the setup: https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
    - 📌 This walkthrough video I found on Youtube will really help (for Mac users): https://youtu.be/nZYJKXXMvkM
- 📝 How to install and use MDBootstrap and Bootstrap 5 to create responsive websites
- 📝 Using the prettier code formatter to beautifully format code in VS Code (my favorite editor)
- 📝 How to flash messages and display them in Flask
- 📝 Encrypting password with Flask's werkzeug.security package
- 📝 Resizing large user profile images before they're added to file system (using a Python package called Pillow)
